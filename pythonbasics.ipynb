        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        " - python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and it is first released in 1991.\n",
        "  it is poplar because it is easy to write ,simple,versatile and have lot of rich libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "   - interpreter translates code line by line and execute it directly.\n",
        " 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    - Python has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers and have specific meaning.\n",
        "  4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "     -   no ,keywords be used as variable names.\n",
        "  5.   What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "     - mutability refers to changing of value after created. type of mutable is list.\n",
        "  6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "    - Tuple and list data structures are very similar, but one big difference between the data types is that lists are mutable, whereas tuples are immutable.Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values but list can be changed.\n",
        "   7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "    - == compares values; is compares identities (memory locations).\n",
        "   8. 8 What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "    - Logical operators in Python, also known as Boolean operators, are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate expressions based on their truth values (True or False).\n",
        "    9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "    - type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another in Python.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "      - Implicit casting is done without you needing to ask for it and explicit casting is done when you ask for it.\n",
        "     11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "      - Conditional statements in Python are used to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.\n",
        "      12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "       - if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "       13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "       - for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, whereas execution is done in a while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong.\n",
        "       14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "       -  for loops are best when the number of iterations is known, whereas while loops are best when it's uncertain.\n",
